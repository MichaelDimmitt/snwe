# snwe

Proof of concept of a system monitor running on electron. At this stage of development it replicates a good number of [supernerd](https://github.com/blahsd/supernerd.widget) features while allowing great room for expansion of functionality and less overhead. Comes at the price of reduced customisability.

To install:

`brew install npm`

`git clone https://github.com/blahsd/snwe`

Then navigate to wherever you cloned the repo and:

`npm start`
